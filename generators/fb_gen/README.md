This contains generators used for tracks like [6900 hexagons ft.fierybowser
](http://frhd.co/t/985096-6900-hexagons-ft-fierybowser) and [69 squares ft.protvod
](http://frhd.co/t/994321-69-squares-ft-protvod).

But the random generators are private.

However I'm working on a generator where you put the direction of the hexagons, so that's coming soon.

Update: It's not coming soon, I deleted most of my work on accident that isn't on this repo. It might still be on a hard drive somewhere, but I don't think so and I'm too lazy to look.
